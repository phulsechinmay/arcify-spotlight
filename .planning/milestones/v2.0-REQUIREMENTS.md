# Requirements: Arcify Spotlight v2.0

**Defined:** 2026-02-06
**Core Value:** Fast, keyboard-driven tab and URL navigation that feels native to Chrome

## v2.0 Requirements

Requirements for Fuse.js search architecture. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Matching Engine

- [x] **MATCH-01**: All data sources use Fuse.js for fuzzy matching instead of hand-rolled fuzzyMatch()
- [x] **MATCH-02**: Title matches weighted higher than URL matches via Fuse.js field weights
- [x] **MATCH-03**: Match threshold configured to eliminate false positives on short queries (e.g., 2-3 char)
- [x] **MATCH-04**: Each result includes a match quality score (0-1) from Fuse.js
- [x] **MATCH-05**: Bookmarks use Fuse.js matching (replacing Chrome's substring-only search)

### Scoring System

- [x] **SCORE-01**: Scoring uses weighted multi-signal formula (type + matchQuality + recency + frequency)
- [x] **SCORE-02**: Source type priority preserved (open tabs > pinned tabs > bookmarks > history > top sites > autocomplete)
- [x] **SCORE-03**: History results incorporate recency signal (recently visited pages score higher)
- [x] **SCORE-04**: History results incorporate frequency signal (frequently visited pages score higher)
- [x] **SCORE-05**: Autocomplete suggestions score competitively when few local results match

### Performance

- [x] **PERF-01**: Data sources fetched in parallel via Promise.allSettled() instead of sequential awaits
- [x] **PERF-02**: Double debouncing eliminated (single debounce layer, not overlay 150ms + SearchEngine 150ms)
- [x] **PERF-03**: Local results display immediately while autocomplete results append when ready (progressive rendering)

### Regression Safety

- [x] **REG-01**: All existing tests pass after migration (337 tests)
- [x] **REG-02**: Deduplication, Arcify enrichment, and action routing unchanged
